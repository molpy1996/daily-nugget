# Next.js & Strapi Fullstack Standards

## Tech Stack Specifics
- **Next.js:** Always use App Router and React Server Components (RSC) by default. 
- **Client vs Server:** Only use 'use client' for interactivity. When you add it, explain the "Component Boundary" you are creating.
- **Tailwind:** Use utility classes. Avoid arbitrary values (e.g., use `mt-4` not `mt-[17px]`). 
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode is mandatory. Use Interfaces for data structures. No `any` types.
- **Strapi:** Assume we use the REST API. Use a `services/` or `lib/strapi.ts` file to centralize API calls.

## Project Structure
- **Components:** Place UI logic in `@/components/ui` and business logic in `@/components/features`.
- **Hooks:** Custom logic should be extracted into `@/hooks/` to keep components clean.

## Teaching Requirements
- **Directory Logic:** Whenever you suggest a new file, explain why it belongs in that specific folder.
- **Data Flow:** When fetching from Strapi, explain the flow: "Strapi API -> Service Layer -> Server Component -> Client UI."
